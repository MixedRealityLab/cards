            Thank you for visiting our website. This brings together a number of (Responsible Innovation) card- based tools. These
            have been developed by people and activities connected to the work conducted at Horizon Digital Economy at the
            University of Nottingham. This website is intended to act as a resource to bring together, showcase and introduce the
            tools, make them available and support and suggest some ways you might like to use them in your work.

            Horizon has found that using card- based tools both in face to face and online settings is a valuable way of helping
            people to think about their work more widely, engage with Responsible Innovation and hopefully shape their work
            accordingly

            Cards have a physical, aesthetic and interactive appeal that enables and encourages engagement and discussion, both in
            person and online.
            
            Card- based tools can be used flexibly in varied ways in quick and more in-depth contexts both individually and with
            groups of differing sizes. They break down complex issues into individual cards to prompt discussion and engagement,
            providing a narrative infrastructure and a set of appropriate anchors with interpretive flexibility
            for discussing complex topics. They have a physical tactile, appeal. People like to hold them sort them and deal them
            with their physical nature lending themselves to promoting discussion and interaction and physical sorting and
            arrangement to prioritise, rank and sort issues amongst other activities. Practical tools for bringing wider values into
            research and innovation are lacking. These cards seek to help address this gap, by supporting engagement with element of
            responsibility such as legal and ethical concepts through their translation into a more accessible form.

            Broadly speaking Responsible Innovation seeks to promote consideration of whether Science and Innovation is, Ethically
            Acceptable, Societally Desirable and Sustainable ([Von Schomberg, 2011](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2436399)).These are complex, nuanced, situated concepts and the flexible
            contextual use and nature of cards suits this well.

            Horizon and associated projects have developed and worked with a number of card sets. These cards are briefly introduced
            below with further details available on pages dedicated to the individual card sets linked to from above.

            The Responsible Innovation Prompts and Practice cards introduce Responsible Innovation and provide a series of ‘prompts’
            and ideas for implementing it in ‘practice’ in research work.

            The Moral-It cards encourage engagement with ethical questions in relation to the development of technology particularly
            that using personal data. They are intended to help integrate ‘ethics by design’ into the development of technology.

        text: |-
            The Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) cards are intended to help people engage with questions of inclusivity in
            relation to their (research) work, such as How inclusive is my work? Who might it include or exclude and how? and how
            does EDI relate to me and my work.

            The ‘Ethics In Research’ cards are intended to help those involved with research identify and reflect on the ethical
            aspects of research.

            The Policy cards have been developed to help researchers define and develop evidence-based policy campaigns based on
            their work.

        text: |-
            The ‘Talking Robots’ cards capture and illustrate some public perspectives on robotics to enable researchers and
            technologists to engage with issues raised and develop more responsible robotics in response to perspectives of the
            public.

            This website has been created as part of the hoRRIzon project, supported by Horizon Digital Economy Research, funded by UKRI (grant EP/V00784X/1). 
            
            This
            project has sought to explore, research and develop approaches to Responsible Innovation as well as supporting the
            integration of elements of Responsible Innovation into Horizon projects, teaching and beyond. Much of the individual
            elements have been supported by Horizon, with others being supported by other projects, highlighted on the individual
            project pages.

            More information on Horizon Digital Economy Can be found on the project website:
