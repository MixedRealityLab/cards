          They are intended to be a starting point to help engage 
          with RI in relation to a project or piece of work.
          They do this by representing elements of the AREA 4P RI 
          framework as cards allowing people to engage and reflect on 
          RRI in relation to their work.

      Considerations of responsibility are becoming more prominent
      and important, but it may be new or unfamiliar to people.
      They therefore need and introductory way to help in understanding
      and engaging with it in relation to their work.

          To help with this the RI prompts and practice cards introduce RI through 20 main cards, each representing a element of
          the AREA 4P framework (1 introduction and 4 cards for each of the AREA elements). Each card contains a series of
          questions as ‘Prompts’ and suggested actions as ‘Practice’ to help them begin to consider RI in relation to their work.
          They are supported by a series of suggested activities and we encourage people to come up with their own.
  - text: The RI Prompts and Practice cards were developed as part of the HoRRIzon project.

          Those involved included Chris Greenhalgh, Virginia Portillo, Peter Craigon, Liz Dowthwaite, Elvira Perez Vallejos,
          Helena Webb, Hanne Wagner, Bernd Stahl and Carolyn Ten Holter and they have been supported by and used with projects
          including those of Horizon, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Programme and Responsible AI UK.

          The 20 ‘main’ cards are divided into 4 sets of 5 cards across the intersection of themes from the framework of AREA –
          Anticipate, Reflect, Engage and Act and the 4 'P's of purpose, product, process and people. Each set has an introductory
          card and 4 prompts and practice cards. The white instruction cards provide wider context and suggested ways of using
          them and the black ‘can you agree’ cards provide a series or prompts to help prioritise and structure discussion and
          use.

          The Colour of the card represents the theme of the card  (Anticipate, Reflect, Engage, Act).

          - Each card has a title to summarise the combined theme of the card.
          - The top half of the card provides a series of example questions as prompts under this theme.
          - The bottom half of the card provides a set of example actions related to the theme.
          
          The bottom of the card shows how the elements of the AREA 4P framework intersect as represented by this card. In this
          case the card Unintended Consequences is part of the ‘Reflect’ element of the AREA framework and
          ‘Product’ category of the 4 ’P’s, as labelled on the bottom of the card.
