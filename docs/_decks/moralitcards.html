            They are intended to be used in varied flexible ways to help people consider ethical questions in relation to
            technology, particularly relevant to ones using personal data and potentially design technology accordingly.
  - text: The cards were developed by Lachlan Urquhart and Peter Craigon at Horizon Digital Economy at the University of Nottingham.

            Inspired by legislative changes, such as the new General Data Protection Regulation, we recognise the need to build
            *legal compliance* into technologies by design and default. High profile scandals of data misuse have increased calls for
            technologies to be developed in more *ethically* sound ways too.
            
            They build on work done by Lachlan about cards for privacy by design REF and were expanded to cover wider ethical,
            privacy, security and legal issues to provide a tool for ‘ethics by design’ of technology
  - text: People are increasingly aware of the ethical implications of the development of new technology yet there is a lack of tools and approaches to engage with this in a systematic pragmatic way

            We feel that practical tools for bringing wider values into IT design are lacking. These cards seek to address this gap,
            by supporting engagement with legal and ethical concepts through a process of translation into a more accessible form.

            Building on the concept of Ideation Cards as tools to help structure and inspire creativity in design settings the
            Moral- IT cards are provide a flexible tool to be used in varied ways to provide prompts and questions to help embed
            ethical considerations into the design of technology through ‘ethics by design’ They are not intended to be
            comprehensive but provide a set of appropriate prompts and questions to promote engagement around significant issues in
            the ethics of technology design. (to help produce more responsible technology)
  - text: There are 72 cards split into the 5 categories of Ethics, Security, Law, Privacy and Narrative.
    chunks:
  - text: Each card belongs to a category and has a Title, Image and question

            The colour of the card and icons show which set the card belongs to which is also identified on the back.
            
            The title identifies the card and the issue that it represents
            
            The image illustrates the concept and potentially provides an alternative perspective and promote discussion about the
            concept shown on the card
            
            Underneath the image is an open question referring to ‘your technology’ to promote engagement and encourage reflection
            and answering in relation to a technology under consideration to promote engagement. On the corners are markings which
            enable you to use them as playing cards – but bear in mind that the backs are different colours so might affect any game
            you choose to play.

            Some examples include:
            
            Process board assessment – as described in the paper REF this involves choosing a technology and using the cards to
            identify risks, mitigations and challenges. This has been developed to consider both benefits and positives as well as
            harms and risks in subsequent work to encourage reflections on both positives and negatives of a technology.
            
            Individually reflecting on the questions
            
            Integrating the cards into the design of a technology for ‘ethics by design’ As the paper says MORE
            
            Retrospectively using them to reflect on a particular piece of technology. Come up with your own
