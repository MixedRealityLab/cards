            They are intended to be used in varied ways to help engagement with elements of EDI to help make work more inclusive.
            They are underpinned by three questions which they are intended to help people answer
            - How inclusive is my work?
            - Who does it include or exclude and how?
            - How does EDI relate to me and my work?

            Issues of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) are embedded in and inherent to research and work. They are becoming
            more prominent with legal requirements, policy aspects and expectations influencing the work of researchers and beyond.
            Appreciations and understanding of how EDI issues are manifest in work and activities are varied but may not be well
            appreciated or understood. Considering that work should be as inclusive as possible and greater inclusivity is desirable
            then the EDI cards are intended to help people appreciate how issues of EDI affect their work. This will hopefully lead
            to the identification of how inclusivity may be improved, particularly as individuals may be unsure or lack the
            confidence or experience to do so.

        EDI Cards were developed by Peter Craigon, Debra Fearnshaw, Oliver Fisher and Emma Hadfield-Hudson, with Nicholas Watson and Sarah Sharples at the University of Nottingham.

            This work was funded by the EPSRC through Connected Everything (grant EP/S036113/1), and UKRI through Horizon Digital Economy (grant EP/T022493/1) 
            and the Future Food Beacon at the University of Nottingham.

            Their initial development is described in: Peter Craigon, Debra Fearnshaw, Oliver Fisher, and Emma Hadfield-Hudson. 2023. The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

  - text: The EDI cards comprise 156 cards divided into 4 themes and 12 individual categories (and guide cards)
    chunks: 
      - type: "text-2"
        text: |-
            **Definitions** – To help people understand what is meant by EDI. This theme includes the categories:

            - Definitions,
            - Legal Definitions
            
            **Scenario** – To help people identify elements of their own work which may contribution to issues of EDI. This theme includes the categories:
            
            - Protected Characteristics,
            - Other Characteristics,
            - Activity or Context,
            - Inclusion or Exclusion,
            - Industrial Digital Technologies (included due to the focus of Connected Everything on Digital Manufacturing)
            
            **What am I going to do?** – To provide a set of examples approaches that could be applied to help improve EDI. This theme includes the categories:
            
            - Approach,
            - Measures of Success
            
            **Complications and Practicalities** – To help people engage with a range of elements that may complicate efforts to improve issues of EDI. This theme includes the categories:
            
            - Complications,
            - Uncomfortable questions?
            - Digital Manufacturing Challenges (included due to the focus of Connected Everything on Digital Manufacturing)

            At the top is an image which is intended to illustrate, prompt reflection and potentially provide an alternative
            perspective on the issue of the card in relation to EDI.
            
            Underneath is the title of the card which identifies the issue the card represents
            
            Underneath a brief explanation of the issues of the card is provided.
            
            Underneath this explanation are open questions which are intended to provoke and promote discussion as to how the issue
            of the card relates, (or doesn’t) to the work of the users or the focus of discussion.
            
            At the bottom is the name of the category that the card belongs to in between two coloured stripes that match the back
            of the card.
            
            The back of the card is coloured according to the category of the card with the name of the category at the bottom and the wider theme that ie belongs to at the top. (The guide cards are different with the back identifying the theme of the card and the front providing information to help guide users to develop their own use and activities with the cards)

            The guide cards provide some suggestions to help you come up with and tailor use of the cards to your own needs and
            promote productive and respectful discussion. Two approaches we have used that work well are:
            
            **Random Draw**

            - Pick a card from random and then discuss it, e.g your understanding or experience of it depending on what you are happy
              to share an discuss.
            - Pick a second card at random (From a different theme) and discuss again but move on to discuss how this new card
              combines (or doesn’t) with the previous, one selected.
            - Repeat by picking further cards and discuss again how these combine with those previously selected.
            - Continue or repeat. 
            
            We have found that drawing combinations of cards at random produces really rich interesting
            discussions of EDI in (complex) context.
            
            **EDI by Design** 
            
            In relation to a focus, project or piece of work, select cards to identify:
            - EDI positives and negatives of the project,
            - ways of maximising the positives and minimising the negative and
            - complications and practicalities of doing this.

            This can be done in advance for EDI by Design to design EDI elements into the work of the project or retrospectively to
            reflect on a project and how it could be improved in the future for examples.
