            They are intended to be used in varied ways to help engagement with elements of EDI to help make work more inclusive.
            They are underpinned by three questions which they are intended to help people answer
            - How inclusive is my work?
            - Who does it include or exclude and how?
            - How does EDI relate to me and my work?
  - text: They are intended to help people appreciate how issues of EDI might affect them and their work.

            Issues of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) are embedded in and inherent to research and work. They are becoming
            more prominent with legal requirements, policy aspects and expectations influencing the work of researchers and beyond.
            Appreciations and understanding of how EDI issues are manifest in work and activities are varied but may not be well
            appreciated or understood. Considering that work should be as inclusive as possible and greater inclusivity is desirable
            then the EDI cards are intended to help people appreciate how issues of EDI affect their work. This will hopefully lead
            to the identification of how inclusivity may be improved, particularly as individuals may be unsure or lack the
            confidence or experience to do so.

        EDI Cards were developed by Peter Craigon, Debra Fearnshaw, Oliver Fisher and Emma Hadfield-Hudson (Nik Watson, Sarah
        Sharples) funded by the Connected Everything, Horizon Digital Economy and the Future Food Beacon at the University of
        Nottingham

            - Complications,
            - Uncomfortable questions?
            - Digital Manufacturing Challenges (included due to the focus of Connected Everything on Digital Manufacturing)

            At the top is an image which is intended to illustrate, prompt reflection and potentially provide an alternative
            perspective on the issue of the card in relation to EDI.
            
            Underneath is the title of the card which identifies the issue the card represents
            
            Underneath a brief explanation of the issues of the card is provided.
            
            Underneath this explanation are open questions which are intended to provoke and promote discussion as to how the issue
            of the card relates, (or doesn’t) to the work of the users or the focus of discussion.
            
            At the bottom is the name of the category that the card belongs to in between two coloured stripes that match the back
            of the card.
            
            The back of the card is coloured according to the category of the card with the name of the category at the bottom and the wider theme that ie belongs to at the top. (The guide cards are different with the back identifying the theme of the card and the front providing information to help guide users to develop their own use and activities with the cards)
